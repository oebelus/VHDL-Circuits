# Encoders

Binary encoders are used to represent integers by binary numbers expressed in base two.

## Octal Encoder

- Employed to represent integers by binary strings, and it's a binary encoder.
- It is used to represent the integers 0; 1; 2; . . .; 7.
- It accepts a digit in the range 0â€“7 and outputs a 3-bit binary string.

## Priority Encoder

In priority encoder, the integers to be encoded have different priorities.

If a numbers of integers are to be encoded at the same time, then the number having the largest priority is encoded.

The operation of the octal priority encoder is:

Let's assume that the integers 1, 3 and 5 are to be encoded at the same time. The integer 5 which has the highest priority is encoded.

## Hexadecimal Encoder

| Hexadecimal | Binary |
| ----------- | ------ |
| 0           | 0000   |
| 1           | 0001   |
| 2           | 0010   |
| 3           | 0011   |
| 4           | 0100   |
| 5           | 0101   |
| 6           | 0110   |
| 7           | 0111   |
| 8           | 1000   |
| 9           | 1001   |
| A           | 1010   |
| B           | 1011   |
| C           | 1100   |
| D           | 1101   |
| E           | 1110   |
| F           | 1111   |

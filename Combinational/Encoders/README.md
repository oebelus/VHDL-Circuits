# Encoders

Binary encoders are used to represent integers by binary numbers expressed in base two.

## Octal Encoder

- Employed to represent integers by binary strings, and it's a binary encoder.
- It is used to represent the integers 0; 1; 2; . . .; 7.
- It accepts a digit in the range 0â€“7 and outputs a 3-bit binary string.

## Priority Encoder

In priority encoder, the integers to be encoded have different priorities.

If a numbers of integers are to be encoded at the same time, then the number having the largest priority is encoded.

The operation of the octal priority encoder is:

Let's assume that the integers 1, 3 and 5 are to be encoded at the same time. The integer 5 which has the highest priority is encoded.
